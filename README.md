# DijkstraAlgorithm
## The simple Java implements of the  Dijkstra algorithm
## Question:Find the least cost of the path from Node S to Node E.   
## The Graph is like this:

## Core Algorithm:  
#### Maintain 3 tablesï¼š  
#### One for Graph: the key is a node,the value contains all the neighbour nodes and its cost to the node.  
#### One for Cost: the key includes all the nodes, the value represents the present least cost to the node S.   
#### If there is no idea, typed in a maximum value first(e.g 1000).  
#### The last one for Parents: the key includes all the nodes, and the value is its parents node.

#### So the process is below:  
**From the Node S, find its neighbours, deal with the neighbours one by one at the order of from the least cost to the     
highest cost. At each neighbour node, the cost to node S pluses the cost to a neighbour, then get the cost from the    
node S to the neighbour node. If the cost less than the vlaue on the Cost table, replace this cost value, and record      
this node as the neighbour's parents on the Parents table. Go on and calculate all the nodes, then got the least cost     
value of all the nodes to the node S and the parents node of each nodes which is on the path of the least cost.**
